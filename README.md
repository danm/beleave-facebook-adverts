# beleave-facebook-adverts
Advertising from leave campaigns including DUP, VoteLeave, BrexitCentral, BeLeave handed over by facebook to DCMS - I've flattened them to make them easier to work with and analyse. Incuded are excel files, TSV and JSON. All content extracted from the PDFs which are also included in this repo originally shared from https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Fake_news_evidence/Ads-supplied-by-Facebook-to-the-DCMS-Committee.pdf

The script I wrote to extract and format the data is also included.

Next up is extractin the images from the other PDF files.
