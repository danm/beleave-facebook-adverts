# beleave-facebook-adverts
Advertising records from leave campaigns including DUP, VoteLeave, BrexitCentral, BeLeave handed over by facebook to DCMS - The data includes the message which went along with the advert in additon to the type of targeting used. I've flattened the data to make them easier to work with and analyse. Incuded are excel files, TSV and JSON. All content extracted from the PDFs which are also included in this repo originally shared from https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Fake_news_evidence/Ads-supplied-by-Facebook-to-the-DCMS-Committee.pdf

The script I wrote to extract and format the data is also included.
